                    <p>An open letter to architects and other creatives</p>

                    <p>Following the prime minister’s triggering of Article 50, today we officially launch Londonon and an open call for interest from London based architects and creatives as a direct response to the government’s challenge to explore global opportunity.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is undeniable that we are at a critical juncture in international politics, cultural identity and urban development. However, as creatives based in one of the most intense and thriving international cities, we are in a unique position. We can, and must, look outward to learn from others and share our own stories as well.</p>
                    
                    <p>Londonon is a rolling research and residency programme in cities around the globe run by collaborating London-based architects and creatives. We pool resources, question, collaborate, make and experience, to broaden our minds, expand our reach and widen our worldview.</p>
                    
                    <p>Londonon is conceived as a filter for ambitious, small to medium-sized creative practices, through a non-profit organisational structure. We desire to learn about our host city, our own conditions in London, and ourselves in a global situation.</p>
                    
                    <p>The programme will follow the outlined Brexit timetable, starting with a period of planning and research, followed by a recurring three-month placement for select individuals from involved organisations. Team members will work alongside local practices, cultural and education bodies, government agencies and other invested stakeholders to respond to shared urban challenges. At the end of 24 months, when Ms May’s negotiation period expires, we will host an exhibition of our findings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Londonon was soft launched at the Department of International Trade pavilion at MIPIM 2017 by way of a roundtable debate with representatives of the Londonon programme along with industry representatives from the architectural profession, the UK Department of International Trade and members of the UK press. We are now inviting likeminded professionals to take back control of our own aspirations, ambitions and ultimately creative processes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Londonon is set to express our capital’s strengths. We are adaptive, light footed, rich, intensive, open minded, understanding, welcoming. Most importantly, we will express the optimistic entrepreneurial spirit this city reinforces in each of us.</p>
                    
                    <p>Come and join our conversation.</p>
